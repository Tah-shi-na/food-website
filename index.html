            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet. “By choosing healthy over skinny you are choosing self-love over self-judgement.” – Steve Maraboli.</p>

                <h2>Beef Recipe</h2>
                <p>Cutting crosswise against the grain or muscle fibers makes it easier for tenderizing. Skirt or flank steaks are excellent for grilling and may require much more than slicing against the grain. Using acidic ingredients like vinegar, or lemon juice breaks down tough proteins and add flavor to your beef cut.</p>

                <h2>Meat Recipe</h2>
                <p>Chicken, fish, beef, chicken and lamb (and other meats and poultry) are all easy to cook (but you can make it difficult on yourself with elaborate recipes). The trick is to match the cooking method to the type of meat and the particular cut.!</p>

                <h2>Lentil Recipe</h2>
                <p>
                Lentil soup may include vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, celery, parsley, tomato, pumpkin, ripe plantain and onion. Common flavorings are garlic, bay leaf, cumin, olive oil, and vinegar. It is sometimes garnished with croutons or chopped herbs or butter, olive oil, cream or yogurt.</p>
